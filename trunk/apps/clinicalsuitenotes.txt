Clinical Suite notes
Open this to take notes of what I want to change as I work with the suite.
Add option to read RTC from PM.  That way I can verify if clock set correctly after I set it.
Add battery levels to phone app
Add network On display to phone app
Add refresh button
Add refresh continually button
Add display of command,pattern, etc.  Since I would be reading the same block as 
the phone app, might as well set all the same displays that are read in the phone app.

Use getStatus window from netscanner elsewhere in the suite.

Remote module setup, make table editable to be able to set

add sync period to remote module display for reference
add accel setting to rmParameters
add accel setting to remote display for bp>134, PG>164
How best to rearrange order of modules? 
Swap A and B
Shift timing R or L?  Just shift SyncTiming and SyncPush
Is sync period read with BP and/or PG settings?
Is it every written or just for reference?

PDO config - add option to read current configurations
Write PM RPDO does not give message to confirm
That app does not yet have dmessage function. Add that and use an look at response 
for each of the write statements.  Write statements should be 0 if successful, [] if not.
Sum number of errors and return fail if not zero errors.

netscannerf.mlapp - need to remove last comma at end of each line, otherwise imported as extra column
