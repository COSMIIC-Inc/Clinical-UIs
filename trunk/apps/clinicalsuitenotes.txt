Clinical Suite notes
Open this to take notes of what I want to change as I work with the suite.
Need to add window to set the configuration of exclusive mode - 1F57.94
Currently set that directly from the 1F57 window,
ADD update labels for the 1F57 read/write window - could update directly from xls window

**General

Use getStatus window from netscanner elsewhere in the suite.

**Phone app emulation
Add battery levels to phone app
Add network On display to phone app
Add refresh button
Add refresh continually button
Add display of command,pattern, etc.  Since I would be reading the same block as 
the phone app, might as well set all the same displays that are read in the phone app.

Remote module display
add sync period to remote module display for reference

**Remote Module Setup
x Remote module setup, make table editable to be able to set

add accel setting to rmParameters, 2012.1
add accel setting to remote display for bp>134, PG>164
How best to rearrange order stim timing PG modules? 
Swap A and B
Shift timing R or L?  Just shift SyncTiming and SyncPush
Is sync period read with BP and/or PG settings?
Is it ever written or just for reference?

**PDO config
PDO config - add option to read current configurations and compare

** Netscanner
x netscannerf.mlapp - need to remove last comma at end of each line, otherwise imported as extra column
x if VIN not read then need to leave blank

** Needed Parameters
Include place to set ramp speeds and delays for trunk ramp in pattern configurations
