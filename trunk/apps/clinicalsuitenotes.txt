Clinical Suite notes
Open this to take notes of what I want to change as I work with the suite.

in MES recording app, need to add Netork On button for accelerometers, since I turn Off the network when stopping the emg recording
EMG recording, need to disable the stim on/off button while stimulating because it the recording is too fast to allow a stimulation on/off command.

Add Get RTC so that I can see what the clock time is currently.

Add script editor buttons
Add network buttons to main menu
